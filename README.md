## Description
This project (DevHost) uses Terraform to plan, deploy, and destory a Linux VM. This is setup to be run as a manual GitHub Actions Workflow.

Manually initiate the GitHub workflow to build;
- an Azure storage account to store the Terraform state file
- a virtual network for hosting
- a linux VM with a public IP address

## Installation

To utilize this DevHost project:

1. Setup your Repository on github with required variables and secrets.
  - If you are using a _Private_ repository on a free GitHub account, put the variables/secrets into at the Repository level (no Environments).
      - Workflow: **DevHost - Terraform an Azure VM** - used with repository variables (not environments).
  - If you are using Enviroments (Public Repo or Paid GitHub), use the workflow for Environments (_pending_), put the variables/secrets in the environment settings, and leave out the ENV_NAME variable.

    Variables:
    - ENV_NAME
    - LOCATION
    - CIDR_BLOCK
    - STATE_SUFFIX
    - ARM_TENANT_ID
    - ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
    - ARM_CLIENT_ID

    Secrets:
    - ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
    - ARM_TFSTORE_ACCESSKEY

    Notes:
    
    1. The ARM_TFSTORE_ACCESSKEY is used to access the TF State storage file. The TF State provides critical perisistence data to the Terraform deployment.
    1.  ARM_TFSTORE_ACCESSKEY is added to the GitHub "secrets" on AFTER the TFState storage account is deployed.
The single provided workflow uses ENV_NAME to switch between environments. This allows you to use a free and private repo (which does not support Environments).
    1. Create a repository from this repository template [https://github.com/sheeriot/DevHostAzure](https://github.com/sheeriot/DevHostAzure)

## Usage

1. Will need an Azure AD Service Principal. In this example, scoped to a subscription<br>
   ```az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "svc-terraform-myproj" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012```

1. First run the TFState Apply component. You can test with Plan. After TF State is deployed, validate it in the Azure portal. Go to the new Azure Storage Account and get an Access Key to provide as secret ARM_ACCESS_KEY in GitHub.

1. Next deploy the Network component. The terraform state for the Network component will be saved in the Terraform State account. Go look at it. Validate.

1. Setup the Terraform for the new DevHost VM. 
   - add your own source IP address (for SSH access) and SSH Public Key
     - edit the `azure/devhost/terraform.vars` as needed
     - an SSH (TLS) Key-Pair is also created as a terraform resource and stored with terraform state
         - the public key has been provided to the new linux host as an `authorized_key`
         - the private key can be used as an `IdentityFile`
   - modify the terraform as you see fit including the file `scripts/cloud-init.tfpl` to customize your linux host on first boot

1. Update the env.sh file header variables to name your Network and Compute (`INFRA_NAME`, `COMPUTE_NAME`).

1. Deploy your devhost

1. SSH to your devhost using your defined IP address (source) and Public Key (added)
